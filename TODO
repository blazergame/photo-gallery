    ☐ Implement the search function
        When a text is entered and search is clicked, either open a modal of that photo card or say no search found

☐ Need to fix 
    ☐ The photo cards grid is only hard coded. 
        Need to figure out to how dynammically render 4 photo cards then create a new line after 4 columns. Not sure how if I want infinite scroll or pagination
    ☐ I want to move the 'Made with <3 in Seattle' to center
        Can't figure this out at the moment. I tried using text-center but that doesn't work. The flex property in footer forces
        it to stay on the left. If you remove it, the text will go to the right even with text-center
